Neither ShinyHunters nor Scattered Spider have a documented history of directly attacking law
enforcement agencies. On the contrary, some new content began to surface, although details remain
limited due to the potential sensitivity of such activities, and the recent claims of the trio's invasion are
false. Before the group disappeared from public channels, the hacker trio claimed to have breached
several lawenforcement agencies, including the FBI.

In their posts, they published data samples and screenshots suggesting a possible compromise of an
account within an undisclosed law enforcement system. The actor with the pseudonym UNC6395 shared
several text files containing identifiers for various applications and hostnames referencing the US
government. It is possible that the group was attempting to demonstrate resilience following legal actions
taken against one of itsmembers by French and American lawenforcement authorities.

Starting on 10/10/2025, the group became the target of multiple international operations, which led to
the arrests of some members of the Activity Clusters. One arrest was confirmed by the T.A.s, while others
were 'denied' in a sarcastic tone, likely as a way to mask the arrests. Along with this, the main forum for
activities linked to the ShinySpiderswas shut down by the FBI, both on the SurfaceWeb and the DarkWeb
page (in the early hours of 10/26/2025).

In addition to the arrests that became public, we also noticed movements on the Breachstars forum
where the actors attempted to deny the arrests. The group tried creating fake accounts of supposed
Russian speakers, however, the attempt was merely to confuse authorities regarding the locations of
each target, given that the arrests involved French, British, American, Canadian, and Turkish
individuals. In this case, the translation of the Russian user is not applicable as it concerns another
subject unrelated to the UNC's.

Following the publicized arrests, the group effectively began to dissipate, along with farewell "letters" and subliminal messages, such as the one below, identified by me as a member of iT.eam's intelligence team on 10/20/2025 around 11:45 PM. (Brasília local - time (Brazil))

Hello James,
It appears the road you've chosen has led you somewhere words now carry consequences heavier than you imagined.
You should have known silence often speaks louder than insult. A simple conversation might have opened doors; instead you chose to burn the bridge. In the end, sic transit gloria mundi.
From this point, every move will echo farther than you expect. This is no longer a game of names or masks. Consider your next steps carefully, James
