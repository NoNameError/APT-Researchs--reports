### Decisions

**Key Decisions:** To determine the understanding of how
attacks on various companies have developed and how to
protect the internal environment, aligned with the knowledge
and TTPs of new types of attacks.

**Decision-Enabling Data Points:** Context and relevance of the
threat to the organization; Adversary behavior and potential
objectives; Enrichment of Intelligence information to aid
decision-making.

### Executive Summary

In mid-April 2025, a group that had, until then, only been active in a few underground data breach forums
on the conventional web, began to attract attention not only fromlarge corporations but also fromfederal
agencies such as the FBI and the French Police. This was due to their operations and significant impacts,
which generated risk not only to private companies but also to the economy and data privacy of entire
governments.

Me, as memeber of iT.eam's Threat Intelligence (TI) team began a deep-dive analysis of every action taken by this group (at
that time, just a group), leading up to the global impacts that elevated them to a high-relevance APT
(Advanced Persistent Threat). This group exhibited all the characteristics of a persistent threat, from initial
access to internal lateral movement without detection for a longer period than is conventional.
The business risk stemming fromthis threat is categorized as fully critical, rating 5/5, as the sale of this data
facilitates fraud across various domains, including Account Takeover (ATO) targeting CISOs, CTOs, and
CEOs, and social engineering against companies related to the initial target.

An exmaple of the criticality of the actions performed by UNC (Unknow Clusters) 6040 & UNC6395
groups was the British Government's necessity to secure a £1.5 billion for JLR (Jaguar Land Rover). The
attack impacted British economy by up to £2.5 billion, including the effects on nearly 5,000 of brand
suppliers, thereby changing the value of automotive parts and the vehicles themselves. The incident is, to
date, the country's biggest cyber attack in recent history.
As immediate action based on our analysis, the main recommended action is continuous awareness
against phishing and its various types, especially vishing attacks, which are leveraged by the group targeted
in our analysis.

The activity employed in this article involves the study of APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats), which represent
significant risks for governments and companies. These threat actor groups are frequently linked to
espionage cases, whether state-sponsored or focused on the private sector, in addition to the financial
motivations behind each action.

The APT Research activity aims not only to gather TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and IOCs
(Indicators of Compromise), but also to map and delve into their behavior, attack vectors, target
sectors, and motivations. All of this is aligned with the study and infiltration of the threat actors'
free/private communication environments, analyzing their activity over time and mapping the directions
taken by these groups.

With these intelligence sources, the iT.eam SOC (Security Operations Center) can makemore assertive
decisions regarding detections and mitigations, when necessary, against the actions of the studied target
groups. Furthermore, the CTI team conducts internal analyses to refine rules or create new use cases,
congregating information and defenses that will also be applied to our clients, in addition to populating
our IOC databases in our SIEM and MISP.
