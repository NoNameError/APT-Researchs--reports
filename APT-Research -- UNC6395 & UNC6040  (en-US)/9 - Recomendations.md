**Recomendations**

•Conduct regular training with attack simulations (phishing, spear phishing, baiting) to empower
employees to recognize and react appropriately.

•Utilize strong and secure passwords, advising against the reuse of the same password across different
accounts, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

•Implement well-defined restrictions for access and permissions, limiting them only to what is necessary
for the user's function, minimizing risks in case of compromise.

•Apply MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) to all accounts, prioritizing remote access and cloud services.
Whenever possible, require MFA for privileged actions.

•Keep devices, browsers, Firewalls, VPN Clients, and applications updated, which is essential for
correcting known vulnerabilities, especially Browsers.

•Network segmentation with VLANs, which prevents compromise across the entire internal network,
ensuring critical equipment is separated into its own VLANs.

•In addition to the recommendations presented in this topic, based on the analysis of the group's TTPs
along with the studies conducted, the need is observed to create training for the prevention of Vishing
(voice phishing) applied to all employees across all areas, also aligned with awareness about SIM
Swapping and its prevention. Although SIM Swapping does not depend on the client itself, one way to
hinder the execution of the scam is the creation of a PIN for the cell phone chip (SIM), a technique that
few people adopt in their daily lives.
