In the JLR (Jaguar Land Rover) case, the compromise did not occur as a result of the attacks on
SalesForce, but rather due to a CVE in SAP NetWeaver applications, which allowed for RCE (Remote Code
Execution) attacks via HTTP/S protocols, originating fromCVE (CVE-2025-31324).

In August 2025, the SLHP (Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters) actors published a Python PoC (Proof-of-Concept)
in their groups that exploits this vulnerability. This led to massive attacks on several other applications,
resulting in the CVE being considered Critical level (10/10), i downloaded and analysed the exploit written in python to understand and provide new detection rules even with the SAP Netweaver update.

Active exploitation began between mid-March and April 2025, with threat actors sending web shells such as
helper.jsp, cache.jsp, or .jsp files containing randomnames to SAP servers.
Based on the analysis of the exploit provided by the T.A.'s themselves, we noted that the vulnerability
consists of: The 'metadatauploader' endpoint fails to sanitize the uploaded binary template files. It relies
on the client-provided Content-Type: application/octet-stream payloads and parses them as valid
SAP template metadata.

Observed Payloads: they start with PK (ZIP header), embedding compiled .properties + bytecode, which
triggers code execution when parsed.
Impact: Arbitrary code execution within the context of the SAP NetWeaver server, often leading to full
systemcompromise.

**Kill Chain**
Payload Preparation – The attacker creates a ZIP/JAR containing malicious template definitions or
classes.

• Payload Delivery – Send a crafted HTTP POST to /metadatauploader with application/octetstream.
• Upload Accepted – The server writes/uploads the malicious file without validation. Execution – The
code is executed when the template is processed by NetWeaver.
Indicators in the PCAP:
• POST requests to /developmentserver/metadatauploader;
• Content-Type: application/octet-stream with binary content prefixed by PK.

Still regarding the group's communication style, which became a core part of the actors' identity, they use
language with a lot of popular expressions, especially against other threat actors or major personalities in
the cybersecurityworld, as was the casewith Austin Larsen,mentioned previously.

Following this, several companies across various sectors were also affected, notably airlines such as Air
France, American Airlines, and British Airways, as well as luxury companies like Gucci, Victoria's Secret,
and Prada.

Still regarding ByteToBreach, we detected recent activity on the last day, 10/27/2025, around 6 AM (Brasília
time (Brazil)), publishing a dump fromthe Ukrainian transport company "SymbolTransport".
The message contained no mention of the groups the threat actor claimed to be part of, despite being one
of the participants in the attacks on SnowFlake and Salesforce.

The group's communication were also messages with satirical content when they announced that a
Mandiant CEO's password was weak. This reinforces the importance of awareness regarding well-defined
policies for creating strong and rotating passwords. Examples follow below:

<img width="543" height="171" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a214412-0c27-4139-a7ee-cf56a208d895" />

The command uses a Python script called weblogic_decryptor.py to reverse a password that was stored in
an encrypted format by WebLogic. The Oracle WebLogic Server (like many Java application servers) stores
passwords in configuration files so that the server can initialize and connect to databases without the
password being visible.
In a postmade by the group, we can note a mention of the LizardSquad group, which operated strongly for
a short period in 2013 in DDoS attacks against PlayStation services (PSN) on the then-PlayStation 3, and
also against Microsoft's Xbox Live. At the time, there were also leaks fromSony, claimed by the group. The
communication style of the LizardSquad members was somewhat similar to what we see today in
ShinyHunters, always having a provocative and ironic tone when announcing such attacks.
