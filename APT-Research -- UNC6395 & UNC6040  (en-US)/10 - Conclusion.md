**Conclusion**

The landscape of financial and corporate threats is marked by a definitive shift from exploiting software
vulnerabilities to exploiting identity and the human factor. Groups such as UNC6040, UNC6395, have
defined a new standard of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that attack the weakest link in
security: Single Sign-On (SSO) protocols, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and high-value Cloud
applications. Theirmotivation is clear and strictly financial, seeking data extortion and quick fraud.
The threat is exponentially escalated by the introduction of AI-assisted Vishing. Campaigns that exploited
MFA fatigue and executive voice cloning, which previously required considerable human effort, now
become automated, cheap, and difficult to detect. In the Brazilian context, where urgency and trust in
telephone communication are high, this tactic represents an immediate risk of credential leakage and
financial fraud via PIX or corporate transfers, given the recent surge in multimillion-dollar attacks against
financial institutions.

Tomitigate this Identity Extortion Cycle, the strategic focus for large companiesmust be the hardening of
Access and IdentityManagement (IAM). Investment in technologymust be complemented by strict Outof-
Band verification protocols for any critical access request, ensuring that reliance on the phone or email
is replaced by unassailable cross-verification, combinedwith training and awareness regarding Vishings.
